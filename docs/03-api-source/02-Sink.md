## <a name="Sink"></a><code>Sink</code>

A Sink is what a <code>[Source](00-Source.md#Source)</code> subscribes to. All events emitted by the source will be passed to the sink that has been given to the source.

The shape of a Sink is a function which takes an <code>[Event](..\/02-api-event\/00-Event.md#Event)</code> and distributes it to the <code>onEvent</code> function as described below. Sinks also implement the <code>[Disposable](..\/01-api-disposable\/00-Disposable.md#Disposable)</code> construct, and has all of the methods of the Disposable type, and can be treated as a Disposable. This is important as the way to stop a sink \(and also unsubscribe the sources subscribed to the sink\) is to dispose the sink itself. This also means that the way to cleanup or cancel some process when a Sink stops taking values \(for example, when creating a custom Source\), is to add a child to the Sink \(as done on a disposable\), which will then be called when the Sink is disposed. An example of this cancellation ability is say, cancelling a http request.

The sink constructor takes an <code>onEvent</code> function, which is called every time an event is received. When a sink is disposed, it will stop taking values and will ignore all subsequent events received. As well as this, when the sink is active and when the event received is a ThrowEvent or an EndEvent, then the sink will be disposed and then <i>after</i> this the <code>onEvent</code> function will called with the given event. If the <code>onEvent</code> function throws upon receiving an event, then the sink will immediately be disposed and the error will be thrown asynchronously in a <code>setTimeout</code> with delay zero.

<b>Signature</b>

<pre>function Sink&lt;T&gt;(onEvent: (event: <a href="../02-api-event/00-Event.md#Event">Event</a>&lt;T&gt;) =&gt; void): <a href="#Sink-Interface">Sink</a>&lt;T&gt;</pre>

<b>Parameters</b>

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| onEvent | <pre>(event: [Event](../02-api-event/00-Event.md#Event)&lt;T&gt;) =&gt; void</pre> | The callback for when an event is received. |

<b>Returns</b>

| Type | Description |
| --- | --- |
| <pre>[Sink](#Sink-Interface)&lt;T&gt;</pre> | The created Sink. |

<b>Example Usage</b>

```ts
// In this example the source emits values 0..49.
const source = range(50);
const sink = Sink(event => {
    console.log(event);
    if (event.value === 3) {
        sink.dispose();
    }
})
// Subscribe the source to the sink so that it produces values and sends them
// to the sink.
source(sink);
// Logs:
// Push(0)
// Push(1)
// Push(2)
// Push(3)
```

<b>Example Usage</b>

```ts
// Passing a sink a throw event.
const sink = Sink<number>(event => {
    console.log(event);
});
sink(Push(1));
sink(Throw(new Error('some error was caught')));
sink(Push(4)); // Ignored.
sink(End); // Ignored.
sink(Throw(...)); // Ignored.
// Logs:
// { type: PushType, value: 1 }
// { type: ThrowType, error: Error }
```
